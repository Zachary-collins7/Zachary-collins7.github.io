## Features

The MERN Stack Boilerplate comes packed with a variety of features to accelerate your development process and provide
a solid foundation for your project. Here's a quick overview of what you can expect:

#### 1. TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability. With the
boilerplate, you get a TypeScript setup right out of the box, ensuring type safety and improved developer experience.

#### 2. React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This boilerplate includes a pre-configured React
setup, allowing you to create dynamic and responsive frontends with ease.

#### 3. Node.js & Express.js

Node.js and Express.js provide the backend foundation for your MERN application. Express.js is a minimal and flexible
Node.js web application framework, making it ideal for building APIs and handling server-side logic.

#### 4. MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's a perfect choice for MERN
applications as it allows for easy integration with Node.js and Express.js.

#### 5. Easy Setup and Configuration

The boilerplate is designed for simplicity. With just a few commands, you can have your development environment
up and running, ready to start coding.

## Installation

Getting started with the MERN Stack Boilerplate is a breeze. Follow these simple steps to set up your development
environment:

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zachary-collins7/example-mern-tsx
    ```
    That's it! You now have the boilerplate code on your local machine.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd example-mern-tsx
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

And there you go! Your MERN stack application is up and running. You can start building your
frontend in the client directory and your backend in the server directory.

## Conclusion

The MERN Stack Boilerplate is a powerful tool to kickstart your MERN stack projects.
With TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB pre-configured and ready to go, you can focus on
building your application's unique features instead of worrying about setting up the basics.
