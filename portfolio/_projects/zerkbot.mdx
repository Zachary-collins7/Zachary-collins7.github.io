Discord Bot

Created a discord bot to connect users of a game to resources and information provided by the game and the community.
With over 1,400 daily users, I focused on making the bot as efficient and fast as possible while still providing a great user experience.
The bot uses Selenium to scrape the game's website and uses Google Translate and GPT-3 to translate the information into the user's language.
Translated information is cached in a database to prevent unnecessary requests.
Using information provided by the users, the bot calculates insights about the individual user's progress and provides them with personalized information. Personalized information is also translated into the user's language (if supported). The information is also used to hit the game's API to give the user in-game items.
Detailed logs are kept for each user to help with debugging and to provide insight into how the bot is being used. Logs are queried, sorted, and displayed in a dashboard for easy viewing.
A Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are also provided to all users to comply with Discord's terms of service.
