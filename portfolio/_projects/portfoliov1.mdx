## Project Highlights

#### Building Blocks

Portfolio V1 is built upon a robust foundation of NextJS (SSG), ReactJS, TypeScript, and SCSS. This combination ensures top-notch performance,
maintainability, and a delightful user experience.

#### Style with SCSS

The project leverages SCSS modules, keeping CSS class-name collisions at bay. This approach enhances code organization
and simplifies styling, allowing for a more streamlined development process.

#### Type-Safe Development

TypeScript is integrated into Portfolio V1 for live type-checking, resulting in code that is not only error-resistant
but also more reliable and self-documenting.

#### SEO Optimization

Portfolio V1 is equipped with a comprehensive SEO setup, including a sitemap and robots.txt. This ensures that your portfolio
will rank well in search engine results and reach a wider audience.

#### Color Themes

With customizable color themes, this portfolio allows for personalization and branding to match your unique style.

#### Deployment

Portfolio V1 was deployed using NextJS's static site generation to GitHub Pages. It utilizes a work-tree deployment branch
alongside the main branch for seamless updates and maintenance.

#### Google Analytics Integration

Great for gaining insights into the page's most popular content.

#### Custom 404 Page

The portfolio features a custom 404 page, ensuring that visitors receive a user-friendly experience even when encountering
broken links (hopefully not) or non-existent content.
